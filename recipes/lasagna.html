            <li>Fresh herbs (optional): Chopped fresh basil or parsley for garnish.</li>
        </ul>

        <h6>The steps to make the lasagna:</h6>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
            <li>In a large skillet or saucepan, cook the ground meat over medium heat until browned. If using sausage, remove it from the casing and break it into small pieces. Drain any excess fat.
            </li>
            <li>Add the chopped onion and minced garlic to the skillet with the cooked meat. Sauté until the onions are translucent and fragrant. Stir in the crushed tomatoes or tomato sauce, along with the </li>
            <li>Stir in the crushed tomatoes or tomato sauce, along with the tomato paste. Add the dried basil, dried oregano, dried thyme, salt, and pepper. Simmer the sauce for about 15-20 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together. Adjust the seasoning to your taste.</li>
            <li>While the sauce is simmering, prepare the cheese mixture. In a separate bowl, combine the ricotta cheese and grated Parmesan cheese. Mix well until smooth and thoroughly combined.</li>
            <li>To assemble the lasagna, spread a thin layer of the tomato sauce on the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Place a layer of lasagna noodles on top of the sauce, slightly overlapping them.</li>
            <li>Spread a generous layer of the ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles, followed by a layer of shredded mozzarella cheese. Repeat the layers (sauce, noodles, cheese) until you have used up all the ingredients, ending with a final layer of sauce and mozzarella cheese on top.</li>
            <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil, ensuring it's sealed tightly to prevent steam from escaping. This helps cook the noodles evenly.</li>
            <li>Place the lasagna in the preheated oven and bake for 30 minutes. Then, remove the foil and continue baking for an additional 15-20 minutes or until the cheese on top is bubbly and golden.</li>
            <li>Once the lasagna is cooked, remove it from the oven and let it rest for 10-15 minutes before serving. This allows the layers to set and makes it easier to cut and serve.</li>
            <li>Optionally, garnish with chopped fresh basil or parsley for added freshness and presentation.</li>
            <li>Slice into portions and serve your delicious homemade lasagna while it's still warm.</li>
        </ol>
