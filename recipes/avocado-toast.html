            Avocado toast is a popular and versatile dish that features a creamy and rich mashed avocado spread on toasted bread. It combines the smoothness of ripe avocados with a hint of tanginess from lemon juice and the perfect balance of salt and pepper. The creamy avocado mixture is generously slathered onto crispy toasted bread slices, creating a delightful contrast of textures. Optional toppings like red pepper flakes, sliced tomatoes, or a poached egg can be added for an extra burst of flavor and variety. Avocado toast is not only delicious and satisfying but also offers a nutritious and wholesome meal or snack, making it a beloved choice for breakfast, brunch, or any time of the day.
