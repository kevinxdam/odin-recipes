The Odin Project: Recipes Project

# This is the HTML project at the end of the HTML section of The Odin Project. At this point, I am proficient at HTML and understand it. I still need some work on using and understanding git and github to the point where I am proficient.

# AI(chatgpt) is used to generate the information including: descriptions, ingredient lists, and instruction lists which I would have googled and copy/pasted otherwise. The core of the coding is all by hand. The AI is for saving time in a manner that will not affect my learning of coding. I will not be using AI to "cheat" and skip necessary experiences and learning that is only gained by consistent effort/trial and error.
